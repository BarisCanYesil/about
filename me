ðŸ”¹ I am a full stack web & hybrid mobile developer.

ðŸ”¹ I have entensive knowledge about Javascript related technologies (vanilla js, typescript, node.js, angular 2+, rxjs, nosql, jQuery and so on.), in addition to further experience on php and mysql.

ðŸ”¹ I am mainly using Angular (all versions from 2 to 11) on the frontend side. I have developed web-apps via Angular using lazy-loading, interceptors, auth-guards, role-guards, ngx-translate (for multi-language support) and so on.

ðŸ”¹ I have also developed a few mobile apps using ionic (with angular) & cordova for the client side, and php & mysql for the backend (REST API) and published them on Google Play and App Store.

ðŸ”¹ I am able to use both relational and nosql databases according to client's need. I have used mongodb, firebase real time db/cloud firestore, and mysql so far.

ðŸ”¹ I am pretty flexible about quickly learning new technologies when needed, and I am able to deliver all sorts of applications.

ðŸ”¹ Here are some other libraries I have experience with: Fullcalendar (with scheduler), PrimeNG, Angular Material, and so on.
